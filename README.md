#imFreq

imFreq is a script suite for image frequency break-down.
We try to provide visualization and analysis (prospectively also filtering and image reconstruction) tools for spatial frequency bands in images.

##Demo

[**This IPython notebook**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/TheChymera/imFreq/master/imFreq.ipynb?create=1) - which is also included in the repository as ```imFreq.ipynb``` - guides you through the suite's functionality and gives basic instructions.
